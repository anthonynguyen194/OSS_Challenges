# Challenge #2 MONO-POLY

## [NOVICE]
### Goal 
I hid some super secret message in a ciphertext, can you:
Count how many times each letters appear? (List them all)
Figure out the plain text of the cipher.
(Bonus) Figure out the key?

### Cipher Text

### TIPS/HINTS:
* What kind of cipher is it? (Psst! It's not a shift cipher.) Challenge title hint?
* What letter appears the most in the ciphertext? Link: https://learncryptography.com/attack-vectors/frequency-analysis
* Song.
* Trial and error baby.

## [VETERAN]
### Goal
I hid some super secret message using a Vigenere  cipher, can you:
Figure out the plain text of the cipher with this dictionary text file?
Figure out the key?

### Cipher Text
vp fulp go xcvne jbul ziafevny


### TIPS/HINTS
* The length of the key is 4
* The key is a word in the dictionary text file.
* The key and plaintext are all lowercase and are part of the alphabet a - z.
* a = 0, b = 1, c = 2, d = 3 … z = 25
* All words in the plain text are also in the dictionary text file.
* Use your l33t programming skills to solve it.
