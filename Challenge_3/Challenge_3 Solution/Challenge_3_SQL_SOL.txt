[SQL Strings for the Sub-Challenges]

Challenge #1: admin'OR'1=1'#
Reason: The SQL statement checks if the username admin is true and also checks if password provided is true.
This string will make the condition pass regardless of knowing the password to the admin account.

Challenge #2: 5'OR'1=1'#
Reason: The SQL statement is similar to the one above except that it checks if the patient ID provided matches
any patient ID in the database itself. With this it will actually match for all patient ID's in the database thus
resulting in all of the patient's information being outputted.

Challenge #4: junk');INSERT INTO vip (fname, lname) values('John', 'Johnson');#
Reason: We'll complete the initial SQL statement being executed in the server and add our own insert statement. We know 
that the table we're adding into is called vip and we can guess what kind of records there are. (EX:fname, lname, firstname, lastname)
