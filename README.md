# OSS_Challenges
Offensive Security Society challenges with some solutions provided.

## Description
Created security related challenges for the OSS CSUF club: https://oss.org/.

## Purpose
This repo is used to store all the challenges I created for the OSS CSUF club. Each challenge folder should have a README that should describe the challenge.

## Disclaimer
These security challenges are for **educational** purposes. I do not take responsibility for any mishaps.
