# Challenge 1: Phishing Mr. Foobar

## Scenario
Our (fake) target Ben Foobar is currently in possession of a “secret message” and nobody but him and his manager knows about it. Your job is to get that secret message from him and try to decrypt it!

## What you know
* Ben Foobar’s email is mrfubar18371@gmail.com.
* Ben currently works as a Software Engineer (SE) at Raytheon.
* His manager’s name is John Doe.
* Ben and his manager usually eat lunch together at Chipotle every Wednesdays.

## Goal
Try to email and convince Mr. Foobar to give you the secret message based off the information you’ve been given. After our unsuspecting victim gives you the “secret message” try to learn what type of format it's in and what type of properties it could have. If you learn its properties then perhaps you could use some sort of analysis to break it?
Email Mr. Foobar and convince him to give you the “secret message”.
* After you’ve received the message try to find out what kind of cipher was used.
* Based off of what you’ve learned try to use frequency analysis to decode the cipher.
