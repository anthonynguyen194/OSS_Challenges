After getting the cipher code from Mr. Fubar its clear that the type of cipher that he's using is a caesar cipher.
The caesar cipher can be easily solved by calculating the word frequency and guessing the shifts from there. Another better
and simple solution is to simply use an online caesar shift cracker.
